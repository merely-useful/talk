# Hammers and Saws
### What We've Learned from Teaching Research Software Engineering with Python and R

---

# What is a research software project?

- Software is created and run to answer a question
- Papers, theses, and other reports are the product
- The software is "just" a tool
- Shades into projects that produce software for other researchers to use

---

# Who are you?

- Degree(s) in some research domain
- Little or no formal training in software development
  - Which is OK: many professional programmers don't have computer science degrees
- In a team of 1â€“12 people
- Timelines of weeks or months

---

# Where we've been, where we're going

| Then | Now  | Next |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Dropbox | Git repository | Branching workflow |
| "Just do it" | Slack / mailing list | Martha's Rules |
| Interactive analysis | A big pile of scripts | Build tools / CI |
| Word / Google Docs | Notebooks | Site builder |
| "It doesn't crash" | "Are there any NAs?" | Assertions / unit tests |
| "Um, hi?" | README | LICENSE + CoC |
