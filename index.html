# Title

- Bridging gap between introductory coding materials and creating software other people can use, following best practices of OSS development
- Narrative of chapters follows logical progression of package development, adding concepts as they become necessary
- Package developed in the narrative analyzes data to demonstrate Zipf's Law

---

# Title

- Main topics covered: FIXME: insert summary here

---

# Title

- Itâ€™s not only a book! Organized in a way such that it can be used to teach a semester-long university course, complete with exercises in each chapter that build the package

---

# What did we learn about differences in Python and R?

- Why did we write the python book first? Happenstance! We started out working on them in tandem. We decided we needed to focus on one to complete. The Python book was further along, so we went there.
- Python book focuses on more general and transferable themes (CI, etc); R applies packages that obscure processes occurring in the background (probably good we finished Python first)
- Tools taught: Unix in python, but not in R. Interface for Git. Make for automation.
- Things that are "easy" in one language are not necessarily "easy" in the other

---

# What did we learn about writing books?

- It takes longer than you expect
- Working with small to medium-sized team: modeling collaborative approaches covered in the books, content is not one person's opinion and preferences, but aggregates/averages/smooths over idiosyncrasies of individuals to make a more generalizable story
- Tools for writing the books: all are difficult, for different reasons
