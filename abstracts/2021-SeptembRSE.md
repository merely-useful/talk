**Title:**

Hammers and Saws: What We've Learned from Teaching Research Software Engineering with Python and R

**Abstract:**

In 2019, we began writing a set of textbooks to help train research software engineers. The first, which uses Python, has now been published, and the second, using R, should be available next year. This talk summarizes what we learned along the way about the material, the similarities and differences between these research computing ecosystems, and the state of book authoring tools.

**Audience:**

This talk will be of particular interest to people who teach and train researchers who develop software at any level.

**Outcomes:**

We hope attendees will learn of a useful open-access resource (the books are free to read online under a Creative Commons license), and will come away with some useful ideas about how to structure their own teaching and writing.

**Accessibility:**

I have read the Accessibility Statement of the conference and tried to make my material accessible to all. I will upload my slides to the conference platform to be shared with all participants before the conference. I will ensure that my slides use suitably large and legible fonts, that my color choices are accessible to people who are color-blind, and that speakers' notes are available.

**Promotion:**

I will upload the slides to the conference system and website as discussed above and will promote these on Twitter using the hashtag #septembrse and on various Slack channels to encourage attendance. I will provide an email address to allow the audience to pre-submit questions, and will get in contact with various RSE groups, the Carpentries, and R-Ladies to let them know that I am presenting this talk at SeptembRSE.

**Technological Requirements:**

This talk will be slides and voice only - there are no other technical requirements. I would like to be able to run through my talk ahead of time to ensure that I understand how to use the video-conferencing software being used by the conference.
